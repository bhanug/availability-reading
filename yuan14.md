### Findings

1. A majority (77%) of failures require more than one input event to manifest, but most of the failures (90%) require no more than 3.
2. The specific order of events is improtant in 88% of the failures that require multiple input events.
3. Almost all (98%) of the failures are guaranteed to manifest on more than
   than 3 nodes. 84% will manifest on no more tahn 2 nodes
4. 74% of failures are deterministic
5. 53% of deterministic failures have timing constraints only on the input
   events.
6. 76% of the failures print explicit failure-related error messages
7. For a majority (84%) of the failures, all of tehir triggering events are logged.
8. Logs are noisy: the median of the number of log messages printed by each failure is 824.
9. A majority of the production failures (77%) can be reproduced by a unit test.
10. Almost all catastrophic failures (92%) are the result of incorrect handling of non-fatal errors explicitly signaled in software
11. 35% of the catastrophic failures are caused by trivial mistakes in error
    handling logic -- ones that simply violate best programming practices;
    and that can be detected without specific knowledge.
12. In 23% of catastrophic failures, incorrect error handling would have been exposed by 100% statement coverage testing on the error handling logic.


## Categories

- Complexity of failures (most aren't *that* complex)
- Role of timing (often deterministic enough that they could be reproduced in a test)
- Logs enable diagnosis opportunities (logs are good, but noisy)
- Failure reproducibility (these are catchaable in tests if we know where to look)
- Catastrophic failures
    - Trivial mistake in error handlers
    - System-specific bugs


## Opportunities for improved testing

- Starting up services: more than half of the failures require the start of some services
- Unreachable nodes: 24% failures occur because a node is unreachable
- Configuration changes: 23% of failures are caused be config changes.
    - 30% of these involve misconfigurations
    - Remaining majority involve valid changes to enable certain features that may be rarely-used
- Adding a node: 15% of failures are triggered by adding a node

## Limitations

1. Representativeness of the selected systems
1. Representativeness of the selected failures
1. Size of our sample set
1. Possible observer errors

## Conclusions

- We should be able to catch most of these issues in unit testing
- Logs are useful but noisy
- We should put more effort into writing the error-handling code

### Changing how we code

### Changing how we test

- Daniel Jackson's "Small Scope Hypothesis": most bugs have small counterexamples
- Most failure can be reproduced with unit tests
